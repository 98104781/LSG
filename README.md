# LSG

This program is intended to enable the user to generate on-demand (mass)spectral libraries for the identification of lipid species.
Lipids are generated with respect to class and fatty acid composition, spectra are then generated with respect to their adducts.

The fragmentation patterns used to generate the spectra are based on peer-reviewed studies.

Spectral libraries can be exported with the file extension '.MSP' selected.
Otherwise, an Excalibur compatible precursor list (for DDA analysis via orbitrap) or Skylike compatible transition list may be exported by selecting '.CSV'.

An overview of the features along with a brief how-to guide is available on the current release page:
